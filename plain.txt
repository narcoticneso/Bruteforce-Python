A computer science education will give you a solid grounding in logic,
strategic thinking and teamwork--skills you can use whether you choose
a career in CS or go on to medical school, business school or another
field. And of course, CS will enable you to do cool things with
software! Through your elective choices, you can choose to specialize
in databases/data mining, networking and systems, artificial
intelligence, security or software engineering.
A software engineer is consistently rated as one of the top jobs by
Money magazine and Reuters. This isn't just because software engineers
have good salaries; compared to other jobs, they also have great
flexibility and only moderate stress. Some of the great positions you
can earn with your degree are application developer, technical
marketer, system analyst and project manager. Plus, there are many
great jobs reliant on CS that have yet to be invented. Note that all
of these jobs require strong interpersonal skills, so don't think that
computer scientist doesn't get to interact with other people!
